Description: Automatize downloading of meteorological and hydrological data from publicly available repositories:
    OGIMET (<http://ogimet.com/index.phtml.en>), 
    University of Wyoming - atmospheric vertical profiling data (<http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/>),
    Polish Institute of Meteorology and Water Management - National Research Institute (<https://danepubliczne.imgw.pl>),
    and National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
    This package also allows for searching geographical coordinates for each observation and calculate distances to the nearest stations.
